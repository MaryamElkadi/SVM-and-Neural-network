# SVM-and-Neural-network

This project implements three powerful machine learning algorithms:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks (NN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
These algorithms are essential in many applications like classification, regression, image processing, and pattern recognition. The project aims to build and train these algorithms from scratch and apply them to real-world datasets to gain insights into their functioning.

Key Algorithms Implemented:
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

A supervised learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks.
SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.
The project includes a basic implementation of linear SVM and kernelized SVM for non-linear data.
Neural Networks (NN):

A computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information.
This project implements a basic feedforward neural network with fully connected layers, using backpropagation for training.
Neural networks are widely used in tasks like classification, regression, and forecasting.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):

A specialized type of neural network primarily used for image classification and computer vision tasks.
This project implements a basic CNN with layers such as Convolutional Layers, Activation Layers (ReLU), Pooling Layers, and Fully Connected Layers.
